# Tableau_dashboard_Canvas
Project Objective:

- Monitor employee satisfaction levels within the company, both overall and across departments and positions.
- Identify correlations between satisfaction levels and factors like tenure, manager, promotions, and salary.
- Analyze and take appropriate actions to address low satisfaction levels, such as meeting with department managers or conducting detailed work analysis.
- Create a dashboard that provides the following functionalities:
  - View individual employee responses.
  - Compare individual satisfaction levels with department and position averages.
  - Navigate to the employee's work page for further analysis.
  - Support exporting graphs and the entire dashboard as images for presentations.
  - Enable easy updating of previous data.
  - Include a mobile version of the dashboard.
