Problem:
The overall satisfaction level of employees in the company needs to be monitored, both in general and in the context of departments and positions. Additionally, it is important to identify any dependencies between satisfaction levels and factors such as tenure, manager, promotions, and salary. Low satisfaction levels in a department or among individual employees should be analyzed and appropriate action should be taken, such as meeting with the department manager or conducting a detailed analysis of the work. The dashboard should provide the ability to view individual employee responses, compare their satisfaction level with the department and position averages, and navigate to the employee's work page for further analysis. The dashboard should also support exporting graphs and the entire dashboard as images for presentations. Previous data should be easily updated, and a mobile version of the dashboard is desired.
